# Probability Concepts Notebooks

This directory contains a structured collection of Jupyter notebooks, each dedicated to a fundamental concept in probability theory. The notebooks are designed to be accessible to learners with varying backgrounds in mathematics and programming, and use LaTeX for clear mathematical exposition, visualizations for intuition, and exercises for practice.

## How to Use This Directory

- Each notebook covers a single probability concept in depth.
- Notebooks are self-contained and can be studied in any order, though a suggested sequence is provided below.
- All mathematical notation is rendered using LaTeX for clarity.
- Visualizations are included to aid understanding.
- Exercises at the end of each notebook reinforce the material.
- References are provided for further reading.

## Getting Started

- Open any notebook (`.ipynb` file) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Follow the sections in each notebook: Introduction, Mathematical Explanation, Visualizations, Exercises, and References.
- Work through the exercises to test your understanding.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with Python and Jupyter notebooks is helpful but not required.
- All code examples use standard Python libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib) for computations and visualizations.
