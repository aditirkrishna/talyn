## Talyn System Architecture — Quant/HFT Grade

Talyn is engineered for deterministic, high-performance probabilistic simulation and inference. Its architecture is inspired by the demands of quantitative research, HFT, and large-scale scientific computing. Every component is modular, auditable, and built for both extensibility and low-latency execution.

### 1. High-Level System Diagram

```
┌────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐
│  Model/DSL │─▶│   Sampler     │─▶│  Trace Engine │─▶│ Graph Compiler │─▶│ Inference Eng │
└────────────┘   └───────────────┘   └──────────────┘   └───────────────┘   └──────────────┘
```
- **Input:** Model defined in YAML or Python DSL
- **Sampler:** Deterministic, pure Python, supports all core and user-defined distributions
- **Trace Engine:** Captures every random choice and dependency, enabling reproducibility and audit trails
- **Graph Compiler:** Converts traces to DAGs/factor graphs for advanced inference
- **Inference Engine:** Modular, supports MC, BP, particle filtering, and custom methods

---

### 2. Core Engineering Principles

- **Determinism:** All simulations are fully reproducible given a seed; critical for research and production audits.
- **Zero External Dependencies:** 100% stdlib Python for maximal portability, auditability, and deployment ease.
- **Modularity:** Each layer (sampling, tracing, inference) is decoupled and swappable. New algorithms or models can be integrated with minimal friction.
- **Performance:** Vectorized logic where possible, in-place memory management, and optimized event loops for low-latency simulation. Designed for batch and streaming workloads.
- **Mathematical Rigor:** All algorithms are implemented from first principles, with explicit contracts and docstrings. No "black box" logic.
- **Auditability:** Every simulation and inference run is fully traceable, with all random choices, state transitions, and results logged.

### 3. Module/Class Breakdown

- `talyn/simulation/`
  - **sampler.py**: Core RNG, contract samplers, batch simulation utilities
  - **autocorrelation.py, brownian_motion.py, etc.**: Specialized processes for HFT/quant research (e.g., Brownian, Markov, MCMC)
- `talyn/trace/`
  - **trace.py**: Execution trace object, dependency graph, and manipulation utilities
  - **trace_utils.py**: Deterministic replay, trace comparison, and diagnostics
- `talyn/inference/`
  - **mc.py, bp.py, particle_filter.py**: Modular inference engines; each is plug-and-play for research or production
- `talyn/distributions/`
  - **bernoulli.py, normal.py, etc.**: Each distribution is a standalone, auditable module
- `talyn/cli.py`
  - Command-line interface for batch jobs, reproducible pipelines, and integration with shell scripts

### 4. Dataflow and Execution Pipeline

1. **Model Specification**: User defines model (YAML, Python DSL, or API)
2. **Sampling**: Sampler generates all random variables, respecting contracts and reproducibility
3. **Trace Recording**: Every execution is logged as a trace (sample path), including all random draws and dependencies
4. **Graph Compilation**: Trace is converted to a DAG/factor graph for inference
5. **Inference**: Inference engine runs MC, BP, particle filtering, or custom algorithms
6. **Output**: Results include full trace, summary statistics, and (optionally) graph visualizations

### 5. Performance & HFT/Quantitative Design

- **Low-Latency Execution:** All core loops are optimized for minimal overhead; no dynamic dispatch in inner loops. Suitable for real-time or near-real-time simulation.
- **Batch & Streaming Modes:** Supports both batch simulation (for research/backtesting) and streaming (for live trading or monitoring).
- **Memory Efficiency:** All objects are lightweight; traces and graphs can be pruned or compressed for large-scale runs.
- **Reproducibility:** Every run is fully deterministic with a fixed seed, enabling exact replay of any simulation or inference pipeline—critical for regulatory compliance and debugging in HFT.
- **Extensibility:** New samplers, distributions, or inference engines can be added by subclassing and registration. No monolithic dependencies or hidden state.
- **Testing:** Atomic, regression, fuzz, and CLI tests guarantee correctness and performance under all scenarios.

---

### 6. Unique Engineering Decisions

- **No Numpy/Scipy:** All math is explicit, enabling full audit and portability—even in restricted or regulated environments.
- **Explicit Contracts:** Every sampler and inference method has a contract (pre/post-conditions) for correctness and safety.
- **Trace-First Philosophy:** All computation is sample-path based, not static-graph based, for maximal transparency and flexibility.
- **CLI and API Parity:** Everything available in the CLI is also available via Python API, enabling integration in both research and production pipelines.

### 7. Example: HFT-Ready Use Case

Suppose you want to simulate and backtest a probabilistic trading strategy with real-time constraints:
- **Model:** Define your market model and trading logic as a Talyn YAML or Python DSL.
- **Run:** Use the CLI or API to simulate thousands of independent sample paths, each fully reproducible.
- **Audit:** Every run produces a trace, which can be replayed, compared, or exported for compliance.
- **Inference:** Use MC or particle filtering to estimate risk, P&L, or rare event probabilities—on the fly.
- **Scale:** Batch mode for research, streaming mode for live trading, all with the same codebase.

### 8. Extending Talyn for Quant/HFT

- Add new stochastic processes (e.g., jump diffusion, Lévy processes) by subclassing the sampler.
- Integrate with low-latency data feeds or trading APIs via the CLI or Python API.
- Use the trace engine for real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, or strategy debugging.
- Export traces and graphs to standard formats for downstream analytics or visualization.

Talyn is designed to bridge the gap between research-grade probabilistic modeling and production-grade, low-latency simulation demanded by HFT and quant engineering. Every line of code is auditable, extensible, and built for speed.
